Goal: restart the project with a clean structure: fix the unit economics and write the SPEC and AGENTS files for PagaFácil (BNPL for university students).
AI did: Claude (claude.ai chat, not agent mode) reviewed our deck and the course templates, found inconsistencies in the numbers (payback, ARPU, flat 2% monthly rate), recomputed effective annual rates and contribution per loan, and drafted SPEC.md and AGENTS.md. Copilot suggested the commit message for the SPEC.
We decided: kept the BNPL idea and León Lara as the user; accepted the new assumptions (ticket $2,500, 4% merchant fee, 10% cost of funds, 5% default, $40 servicing, CAC $180, 3 loans per customer); pasted the SPEC directly in GitHub because we could not make the change from VS Code yet; the 3-month plan is still an open decision (almost no margin).
Reviewer flags: none yet, the reviewer is not set up. Regulatory figures in SPEC are marked TODO-verify.

## 2026-11-05 · Najhid + Luciano
- Goal: finish the project's context and configuration files before writing any code (DECISIONS, README skeleton, .gitignore, VS Code settings, reviewer agent).
- AI did: Claude Sonnet 5.5 and Copilot (claude.ai chat, agent mode) drafted DECISIONS.md, a README.md skeleton with the run commands left as TODO because no code exists yet, and a .gitignore that keeps .env out of the repo. It adapted the course templates for .vscode/settings.json (added python3 commands for Mac) and for the reviewer agent (.github/agents/reviewer.agent.md), and walked us through uploading files to GitHub with a branch and a pull request.
- We decided: to add the files through pull requests so both partners approve; Luciano reviewed and approved them today and the files are now in the repo. We will review the open points one by one next (3-month plan, maximum installment-to-income share, CAT disclosure, reviewer file path, the professor's eight rules, and the approval row in SPEC.md).
- Reviewer flags: none, the reviewer has not run yet because there is no code to review.
- Correction to the 2026-11-03 entry: the chat tool was Claude Sonnet 5.5.
